        <br>Dogpatch is a vibrant, up-and-coming area nestled between Potrero Hill and the bay. Formerly a shipbuilding
        <br>hub dating back to the 1800s, this dockside area retains an industrial vibe with large warehouses, many of
        <br>which have been updated into residential lofts, art galleries and indie shops. Third Street offers a mix of
        <br>trendy restaurants, brunch cafes, brew pubs and wine bars, plus the Museum of Craft and Design.

        <a id=Wine> </a>
        <p>Neighborhood wine store focuses primarily on French and Itlian labels from known and boutique marker
        <br> Some people may call it highly opinionated-point-of-view. The price range is fairly wide. However,
        <br>the quality is always high enough to make me put in my wine shop list. The owner is extremely knowledgable
        <br>in Frence and Itlay origin. If you are looking for something silky, fruit forward, light body(a.k.a. me),
        <br>you will have a good time here.</p>

        <a id=Pizza></a>
        <p>Long Bridge pizza has been around Dogpatch neighborhood for 2 years. They have expended from one to two units.
        <br>It began as the vision of two childhood friends and Bay Area natives, Neal DeNardi and Andrew Markonlis.
        <br>Long Bridge pizza is named after the wooden causeway that once connected downtown SF to Dogpatch in the
        <br>late 1800s. Our goal is to create a laid back vibe for everyone to enjoy some serious pizza in the neighborhood.
        <br>
        <br>Long Bridge specializes in thin-crust sourdough pizzas. The dough is naturally leavened with organic flour.
        <br>We source the highest quality ingredients. Using influences from classic East Coast, Italian, and San Francisco
        <br>styles, our pizzas provide something for everyone. Stop by before 4pm for sandwiches that are as equally inspired.  </p>

        <p>Chris and Rebecca met at a wine exam in 2012. They went on dates where they enjoyed a lot of food and wine,
        <br>and discussed opening a restaurant “one day.” In that time, they rose to the top of the wine industry,
        <br>got married, and had a daughter. Providing a fantastic guest experience is the foundation of their lives,
        <br>and it is this devotion to the hospitality field that makes them so well-known and liked by their peers
        <br>and guests. They are excited to settle into San Francisco’s Dogpatch and become part of the fabric of that community.</p>

        <p>The problem with opening an ice cream parlor is that you’re always in competition—with neighboring scoop shops,
        <br>of course, but also with an even fiercer adversary: nostalgia. Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous is own by Ian Flores
        <br>and Annabelle Topacio. Their hour is supper short but high traffic in every week which is really smart way to
        <br>keep the customers. There is never a permanent flvor. They roate the them every week. My favor is Thai Basil Chip.
        <br>Classic vanilla base with Thai Basil aroma top with 70% dark chocolate chip. Blending with finsihed sae salt creates
        <br>a nice creamy, balanced, and unique type of dessert.</p>

        <p>Piccino is a SF local litalian restaurant that located in Dogpatch. Their grant opening was in December 2006.
        <br>They have been around for a while. AT first they weren't plan to be a brick and mortar resaurant, but there
        <br>are always people says: “you should open up a restaurant.So, here they are. They also parntner up with Sightglass
        <br>3 wave speciality coffee Shop and opend up their own coffee shop next door. However, I'll say their coffee is
        <br>drinkable. What makes them sucessful is their small quantity theory. When things get big and cooperate, it may
        <br>lost some kind of craft beauty. Piccino has always carry that kind of italian, delicate, but friendly vibe.
        <br>So, go visit!!</p>
